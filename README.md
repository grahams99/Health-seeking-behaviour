This study used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care and death data from Office for National Statistics to identify relevant proxies or markers that could be used to identify health-seeking behaviour and healthcare access in electronic health records. The population under study was all individuals identified in these data that were aged => 65 years on 1st September 2019. The prevalence of these markers was described and compared to national estimates. The prevalence was also stratified by age and gender to understand specific interactions in the data. Dendrograms were produced to understand clustering of these markers in the data.
